JVM Architecture with Class loader sub system :
------------------------------------------------

The three main components of JVM 

1) class loader sub system

2) Runtime Data Areas

3) Execution engine

class loader sub system internally performs 3 task

a) Loading     b) Linking      c) Initialization   (Diagram 9th JAN)

Loading:
----------
In order to load the required .class file, JVM makes a request to class loader sub 
system. The class loader sub system follows delegation hierarchy algorithm to load 
the required .class files from different areas.

To load the required .class file we have 3 different kinds of class loaders.

1) Bootstrap/Primordial class loader

2) Extension/Platform class loader

3) Application/System class loader

Bootstrap/Primordial class Loader :-
---------------------------------
It is responsible to load the required .class file from java API that means all the 
predfined classes (provided by java software people) .class file will be loaded by 
Bootstrap class loader.It is the super class of Extension class loader as well as It 
has the highest priority among all the class loader.

It will load the .class file from the following Path
C-> Program files -> java -> jdk -> lib -> jrt-fs.jar
