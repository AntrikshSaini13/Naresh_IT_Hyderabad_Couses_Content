POC Assignment: Objective: Design a search function that searches the internet and provides relevant YouTube 
links, articles, academic papers, and blog posts on a given search term. The search results should be ranked 
based on factors such as views, likes, and relevance.

Requirements:

Functionality:

Search Engine Integration:

Integrate with search engines or APIs to fetch search results based on the given term. Consider using Google 
Custom Search API, Bing Search API or any other api that you feel suitable for this problem.
Content Sources:

YouTube: Fetch relevant YouTube video links and rank them based on views and likes.
Articles: Provide links to articles from reputable sources.
Academic Papers: Include links to academic papers or research articles.
Blogs: Aggregate relevant blog posts.

Ranking:
Implement a ranking system for the search results based on metrics such as views, likes, and relevance.
Technology Stack:

Backend Framework: Choose a backend framework (e.g., Node.js, Python, Ruby on Rails) to build the 
search function.
APIs:
YouTube Data API: For fetching YouTube video information.
Google Custom Search API or Bing Search API: For searching articles and blogs.
Google Scholar API or PubMed API: For academic papers.
Database (Optional): Use a database to store and manage search results and metadata if needed.
Submission:

Source Code: Provide the source code with clear instructions on how to set up and run the search 
function.
Documentation: Include a brief documentation outlining your approach, the technologies used, and 
any challenges faced. Describe how you handled the ranking and integration of various content sources.
Enhancements for the POC Project:

User Interface:
Develop a simple user interface where users can input a search term and view the results.
Advanced Filtering:
Implement filters to allow users to narrow down results by content type (e.g., only YouTube 
videos, only academic papers).
Performance Optimization:
Ensure the search function performs efficiently and provides results in a timely manner.
We look forward to seeing your innovative solutions and approach to this challenge.,
