1)What is this keyword and what is the use of this keyword ?

   final parameter ref variable of current obj class type
   non-static reference variable of current class type

2)what is current object , how can we access current object members inside a non static method or constructor or NSB ?
3)How should we access NSV/NSM inside other non - static members to develop 
logic common to all objects , and to executes this logic specific to one object ?
4)What are the different use of this keyword ?
5)Prove that :
   1)this is a referenced type parameter variable of cons and NSM
   2)this is final variable
   3)this variable type is current class Type?
   4)this variable contains current object reference ?
6)What are the rules on this keywords ?
   1)can we access it in static members ?
   2)Can we explicitly initialize it with either numm or with object references ?
   3)can we access it in non-static members ?
   4)can we access it at class level in invoking var or method ?
   5)can we print this keyword ?
   6)can we pass it as arg can we return it from method ?


  first case : 
 NV  ---> NB  ---> Constructor   -----> Method(called)  ---> o/p

second case : 
  NB  ---> NV ---> COnstructor -----> Method(called)    --->o/p
