Que- What are the access modifiers ?
     |- scopes of access modifiers ?

It is used to describe the accessibility level of the class as well as the member 
of the class.

a) private  (Accessible within the same class only)
b) default  (Accessible within the same package only)
c) protected (Accessible from another package also but using inheritance)
d) public (No restriction accessible from everywhere)

* most restrictive access modifier
privtae > default > protected > public

     |- can we override the method in same class 
     |- can we override the method in different class 
     |- Rules of modifiers while overriding 
     |- can static method will override

Answer-1
Writing two or more methods in the super and sub class in such a way that method 
signature(method name along with method parameter) of both the methods  must be 
same in the super and sub classes. 

While working with method overriding generally we can't change the return type of the 
method but from JDK 1.5 onwards we can change the return type of the method in only 
one case that is known as Co-Variant.

Without inheritance method overriding is not possible that means if there is no 
inheritance there is no method overriding.

Class is Logiacl Identity its contains the logic of the class

In Java, a class is a blueprint or template for creating objects. It defines 
the properties (attributes) and behaviors (methods) that the objects created 
from the class will have. A class can be thought of as a conceptual model, while 
objects are instances of this model.

Key Components of a Class:
------------------------------
Attributes (Fields/Variables): These are data members of the class that 
hold the state of the object.

Methods: These define the behavior or actions that the objects can perform.

Constructors: Special methods used to initialize objects.

Example:
-------
// BLC
class Car {
    // Attributes (fields)
    String brand;
    int year;

    // Constructor to initialize the object
    Car(String brand, int year) {
        this.brand = brand;
        this.year = year;
    }

    // Method (behavior)
    void displayInfo() {
        System.out.println("Brand: " + brand + ", Year: " + year);
    }
}

// ELC
class MyCar{
	Car myCar = new Car("Toyota", 2020);
	myCar.displayInfo();  // Output: Brand: Toyota, Year: 2020	
}

Output:
Brand : Toyota, Year : 2020

Que- What is Object ?

Object is pysical identity whic is used to execute or perform the behaviour of class.

An object in Java is an instance of a class. It encapsulates both data (attributes) 
and behavior (methods). Objects are created using the new keyword and represent 
real-world entities.

What is Language?

Language is Communiaction Media which is used to communicate each other and eassy to understand.

What is Programming Language ?

A programming Language is an Intermidater between user and Computer System.

Every language contain two important aspects:
1. Syntex (Rules given by language)
2. Semantics (Meaning or Structure of the Language)
 
In the case of Java Programming language we have to type of Security:
1. At Compilation Level : Here our java compiler will verify whether the code
   is valid or not according to the syntax/
2. At the Runtime Level : Here our runtime environment will verify the semantic 
   of the code that means the code is meaningfull or not.
