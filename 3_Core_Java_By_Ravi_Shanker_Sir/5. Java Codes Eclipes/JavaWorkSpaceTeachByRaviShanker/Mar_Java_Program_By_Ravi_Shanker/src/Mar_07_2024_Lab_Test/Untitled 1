Write a Java program to find and print all the leader elements in an integer array.
       A leader element is defined as an element that is greater than all the elements to its right in the array.
       For example, if the input array is {1, 2, 3, 23, 6, 15, 14, 19}.
       the output should be 23, 15, 19 as these elements are greater than all the elements to their right.

Write a Java program to remove duplicate elements from an array and return a new array containing only the unique elements using a method. 

    Assume that the original array contains integers. For example, if the input array is {1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 4}, the program should return a new array {1, 2, 3, 4}.



    Your task is to implement the method removeDuplicates(int[] arr) that takes an array of integers arr as input and returns a new array with duplicate elements removed.

    Make sure to provide the complete Java program with the method implementation.

  Write a java program which will implements sum(int arr[]) method and will return sum of second max and second smallest element of array.
       Example : {1,2,1,1,3,4,5,4,5,5};
       Output : 6  (beacause second max is = 4 && second smallest is = 2 and the addition is = 6)

    Create a Java program consisting of two classes: Student and StudentMain.

       Student Class:

       Define a class named Student with the following instance variables:
       sName: representing the name of the student (String).
       sAddress: representing the address of the student (String).
       rollNo: representing the roll number of the student (int).
       age: representing the age of the student (int).
       Implement a constructor Student(String sName, String sAddress, int rollNo, int age) to initialize the instance variables.
       Provide getter and setter methods for each instance variable to facilitate access and modification.
       Override the toString() method to return a string representation of the Student object.
       StudentMain Class:

       Define a class named StudentMain with a main method as the program's entry point.
       Inside the main method, prompt the user to input the number of Student objects to create.
       Create an array student[] of Student objects based on the user input.
       Prompt the user to input details (roll number, name, age, and address) for each student and populate the student[] array.
       Create another array result[] to store Student objects meeting specific criteria (age >= 18 and address is "Hyderabad").
       Iterate through the student[] array and filter out Student objects meeting the criteria, storing them in the result[] array.
       Display the filtered Student objects stored in the result[] array to the user as the program's output.

     Write a Java program that finds and prints the second largest element in an integer array. 
       Given an array of integers, the program should identify and output the second largest element present in the array. 
       For example, if the input array is {10, 1, 2, 10, 10, 9, 10, 10}, the output should be 9, as it is the second largest element in the array, after 10.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Write a java program which will Implement a Java method, incrementLargeInteger(int[] digits), 
       that takes the array of digits as input and returns a new array representing the large integer incremented by one. 

       Example 1:
       Input: digits = [1,2,3]
       Output: [1,2,4]
       Explanation: The array represents the integer 123. Incrementing by one gives 123 + 1 = 124. Thus, the result should be [1,2,4].

       Example 2:
       Input: digits = [4,3,2,1]
       Output: [4,3,2,2]
       Explanation: The array represents the integer 4321. Incrementing by one gives 4321 + 1 = 4322. Thus, the result should be [4,3,2,2].

       Example 3:
       Input: digits = [9]
       Output: [1,0]
       Explanation: The array represents the integer 9. Incrementing by one gives 9+ 1 = 10. Thus, the result

Write a java program which will implements sorting(int arr[]) method. which will take array as parameter and will return new sorted array in descending order.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Write a Java program that demonstrates sorting objects based on a specific attribute using arrays and loops.

       The program should include the following:

       Define a class named Student with the following attributes:

       student_Name (String)
       student_Id (int)
       Implement a constructor in the Student class to initialize the attributes.

       Implement getter and setter methods for each attribute in the Student class.

       Override the toString() method in the Student class to provide a string representation of the object.

       Create a Java class named Program02 with a main() method.

       Inside the main() method, create three Student objects with different names and IDs.

       Store these Student objects in an array named students.

       Print out the array of Student objects using Arrays.toString() method.

       Create an integer array named id with the same length as the students array.

       Iterate through the students array and store the IDs of each student in the id array.

       Print out the id array.

       Implement a sorting algorithm to sort the id array in ascending order.

       Print out the sorted id array.

       Run and test the program to ensure it sorts the IDs of the students correctly.

       Add comments to explain the functionality of each part of the code.

       Instance variables:-
       ----------------------
       private String name;
       private int id;
       private String company_name;
       private double  Salary;

 Write a Java program that finds and prints all groups of four elements in an integer array whose sum equals a given target number. 
       Given an array of integers and a target sum, the program should identify and output all combinations of four elements from the array whose sum is equal to the given target.
       For example, if the input array is {10, 20, 30, 40, 1, 2} and the target sum is 53.
       the output should be:
       Groups of four elements whose sum is 53:
       [10, 40, 1, 2]
       [20, 30, 1, 2]

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Write a Java program to rotate an array by a given number of times. The program should take an integer array and the number of rotations as input, and then rotate the array accordingly.
       For example:
       If the input array is {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} and the given number of rotations is 1, the output should be {5, 1, 2, 3, 4}.
       If the input array is {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} and the given number of rotations is 2, the output should be {4, 5, 1, 2, 3}.
