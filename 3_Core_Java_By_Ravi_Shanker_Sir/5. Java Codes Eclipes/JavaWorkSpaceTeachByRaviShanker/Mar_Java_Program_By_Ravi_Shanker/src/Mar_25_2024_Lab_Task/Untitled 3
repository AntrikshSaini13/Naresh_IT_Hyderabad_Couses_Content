Program 01 :
-----------
We have two classes called as ReadWrite and Test
For ReadWrite class
Instance Variables:
file: RandomAccessFile
Methods:
No Argument Constructor
read(String, int, int) : byte[]
This method reads the file with filepath and particular position
write(String, String, int): void
Write the data to file starts from particular position.
For Test class
Instance Variables:
path: String: final: static
str: String: static
This class having main() method to test all the Solution's classes and methods
by using try and catch, try must print the read file from ReadWrite read class 
and write the data from variable 'str' into write method in ReadWrite class and 
the position starts from 22. Catch method is catch IOException.

Program 02
----------
We have four classes named as MakeDirectory, MakeFile, DeleteFile and Test
For MakeDirectory
Instance Variables:
dirName: String
file: File
Methods:
MakeDirectory(String) Parameterized Constructor 
Initialize dirName variable
dir() : String
Initialize file variable include path of the file.
We pass the condition, if folder / directory is created by using mkdir() and 
the condition  is true then return variable dirName otherwise it return null.
For MakeFile class
In MakeFile class must be create an file extension is .txt 
Instance Variables:
fileName: String 
file: File
Methods:
MakeFile(String) one argument Constructor
Initialize fileName variable
makeFile() : String : throws IOException
Initialize file variable with new keyword and the path must be your folder 
\\+fileName+".txt"
if file is created by using createNewFile() is true then return variable fileName 
or else it return null.
For DeleteFile class
Instance Variables
fileName: String
file: File
Methods:
DeleteFile(String) One argument Constructor
Initialize file variable with new keyword and the path must be your folder 
\\+fileName+".txt"
if file is deleted by using delete() is true then return variable fileName 
or else it return null.
For Test class
Instance Variables:
No Instance Variables
Methods:
This class having main() method to test all the Solution's classes and methods
If file or folder is created it prints File or folder is created including name 
of file or folder otherwise it prints ''File or Folder filed to create" include 
name of file or folder. 
It catches exception and print message
For Delete file, if the file is available and deleted then print 'file is deleted 
(include file name)' otherwise file is not available it catches 'FIleNotFoundException' 
then print 'Failed to delete file'.
