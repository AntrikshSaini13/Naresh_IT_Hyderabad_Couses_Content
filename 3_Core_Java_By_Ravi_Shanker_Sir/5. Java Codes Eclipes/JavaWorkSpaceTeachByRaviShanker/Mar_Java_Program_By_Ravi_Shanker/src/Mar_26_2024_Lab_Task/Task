 Program 01 
 ----------
 Program to describe Coffee shop application where we can provide coffee type and coffee size.

       Define an enum for different types of coffee constant like cold coffee, Black coffee, milk coffee.

       Define an enum for different sizes of coffee like Small, Big and medium.

       Create one BLC class CoffeeOrder which contains two instance variables which are as follows :

        private CoffeeType type;
        private CoffeeSize size;
      
       Create a parameterized constructor to initialize all fields.
      
       create a non static method getOrderDetails which will return 
       the type of coffee and size of coffee in String format.

       Create an ELC class to print different types of Coffee order by customer using getOrderDetails() methods.

Program - 02
------------
 You're tasked with implementing a shopping application in Java for an online clothing store. 
       The application should allow customers to place orders for clothing items, such as shirts and pants, in different sizes (long and medium). 
       The prices for each combination of product type and size are predefined.

       Based on this scenario, your task is to design and implement the Shopping class in Java. Here are the specific requirements:

       Define enums for product types (Product) and sizes (Size). Product types include "Shirt" and "Pant", while sizes include "LongSize" and "MediumSize".

       Create a Shopping(BLC) class with the following instance variables:

       private Product productType
       private Size dressSize
       private double totalPrice
       Implement a parameterized constructor in the Shopping class that takes Product and Size as parameters.
       This constructor should initialize the instance variables and call a method named setPrice() to determine and set the total price based on the product type and size.

       Implement the setPrice() method in the Shopping class. This method should set the total price according to the following conditions:

       If the product type is a shirt and the size is long, set the total price to 1000.00.
       If the product type is a shirt and the size is medium, set the total price to 900.00.
       If the product type is a pant and the size is long, set the total price to 1200.00.
       If the product type is a pant and the size is medium, set the total price to 1100.00.
       If none of the above conditions match, set the total price to 0.00.
       Implement a method named book() in the Shopping class. This method should return a String representing the booking details. 
       If the total price is 0.00, the method should return "Invalid type". Otherwise, it should return a string in the format 
       "Long shirt is booked and the price is = 1000" or "Long pant is booked and the price is = 1200", depending on the product type and size.

       Now create Test(ELC) class and test the application.
