//Write a Java program named SquareRootCalculator that fulfills the following requirements:
//
//Define the main method as the entry point of the program.
//Initialize a double variable named number with the value 25.
//Implement a method named calculateSquareRoot that takes a double number and a BiConsumer as arguments. Inside this method:
//Calculate the square root of the given number using the Math.sqrt() function.
//Use the BiConsumer to accept the original number and its square root.
//In the main method, invoke the calculateSquareRoot method with the number and a lambda expression to print the results.
//The lambda expression should accept the original number and its square root, then print them in a formatted message.
