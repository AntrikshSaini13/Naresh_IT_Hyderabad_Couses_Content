//Create two user-defined functional interfaces:
//
//
//
//Operation Interface:
//
//A functional interface with the method perform(int a, int b) that returns an int.
//
//The perform method should implement complex mathematical operations based on conditions.
//
//Conditions:
//
//If both a and b are greater than 0, return the sum of the squares of a and b.
//
//If the above condition is not met, return the sum of a and b.
//
//
//
//Greeting Interface:
//
//A functional interface with the method greet(String name, int age) that returns void.
//
//The greet method should implement intricate logic based on age and name length.
//
//Conditions:
//
//If the age is 18 or older, print a greeting indicating that the person is an adult.
//
//If the length of the name is greater than 5 and the age is less than 18, print a greeting indicating that the person has a long name and is not an adult yet.
//
//If none of the above conditions are met, print a suitable greeting.
//
//
//
//In the main method:
//
//Use an anonymous inner class to create an instance of the Operation interface with the implemented complex mathematical operations.
//
//Use another anonymous inner class to create an instance of the Greeting interface with the implemented intricate logic based on age and name length.
//
//Execute the complex mathematical operation with sample values (e.g., a = 4, b = 3) and print the result.
//
//Execute the complex greeting logic with sample age and name values (e.g., age = 38, name = "Virat") and print the personalized message.



//OUTPUT: Result of complex operation: 25
//
//    Hello, Virat! You are an adult.
