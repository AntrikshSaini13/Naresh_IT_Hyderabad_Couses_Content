//Define Weather Conditions:
//
//Determine the weather conditions that are considered suitable for outdoor activities. This might include criteria such as a certain temperature range and the presence of sunlight.
//
//
//
//Identify Input Parameters:
//
//Determine the input parameters required to evaluate the weather conditions. This typically includes the temperature (in Celsius or Fahrenheit) and a boolean indicating whether the sun is shining.
//
//
//
//Functional Interface Design:
//
//Design a functional interface named WeatherConditionEvaluator. This interface should have a method isSuitableForOutdoorActivities(int temperature, boolean isSunny) that returns a boolean indicating whether the given weather conditions are suitable for outdoor activities.
//
//
//
//Implement Evaluation Logic:
//
//Implement the evaluation logic for determining whether the weather conditions are suitable for outdoor activities. This logic should consider the input parameters (temperature and sunlight status) and compare them against the predefined criteria for suitability.
//
//
//
//Test the Program:
//
//Once the logic is implemented, you can test the program with various combinations of temperature and sunlight status to ensure that it accurately determines whether the weather conditions are suitable for outdoor activities.
//
//
//
//By following these steps, you can create a program that determines whether the weather conditions are suitable for outdoor activities based on the temperature and sunlight status, using functional interfaces for evaluation logic.
