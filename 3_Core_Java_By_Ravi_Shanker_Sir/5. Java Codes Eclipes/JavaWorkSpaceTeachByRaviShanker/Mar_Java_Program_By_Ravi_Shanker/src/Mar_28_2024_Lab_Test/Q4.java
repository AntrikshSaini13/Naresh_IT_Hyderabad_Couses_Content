//Write a java program to check whether voter is eligible for vote or not using BiPredicate interface 
//
//The program defines a class named VoterEligibility.
//In the main method, variables name, age, and isCitizen represent the person's name, age, and citizenship status (true if citizen, false otherwise).
//The checkVoterEligibility method takes a person's age, citizenship status, and a BiPredicate as parameters.
//Inside the checkVoterEligibility method, it checks whether the person's age is 18 or older and whether they are a citizen using the BiPredicate.
//In the main method, the checkVoterEligibility method is invoked with the person's details and a lambda expression to test whether the person is eligible to vote.
//The lambda expression tests whether the person's age is 18 or older and whether they are a citizen. If both conditions are true, it returns true; otherwise, it returns false.
//Based on the result of the test, the program prints whether the person is eligible to vote or not.
//This program demonstrates the usage of BiPredicate to evaluate two conditions (age and citizenship status) and return a boolean result based on these conditions. It determines whether a person is eligible to vote based on their age being 18 or older and their citizenship status.
