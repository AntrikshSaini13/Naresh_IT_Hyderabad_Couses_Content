//Scenario:
//
//
//
//You are tasked with developing a user management system for a newly established startup company. As part of this system, you need to implement a feature that generates unique user IDs for new employee registrations.
//
//
//
//Question:
//
//
//
//Write a Java program that generates unique user IDs for new employee registrations using the Supplier<String> interface. 
//
//Your program should include the following features:
//
//
//
//Define a Supplier<String> named userIdSupplier that generates unique user IDs for employee registrations.
//
//Each user ID should start with the prefix "USER-" followed by a sequentially increasing number, starting from "1".
//
//Use the userIdSupplier to generate and print a unique user ID for the first employee registration.
//
//Ensure that each generated user ID is unique.
//
//
//
//Your program should output something similar to the following:
//
//Generated User ID 1: USER-1
//
//Generated User ID 2: USER-2
//
//Generated User ID 3: USER-3
//
//Generated User ID 4: USER-4
//
//Generated User ID 5: USER-5
