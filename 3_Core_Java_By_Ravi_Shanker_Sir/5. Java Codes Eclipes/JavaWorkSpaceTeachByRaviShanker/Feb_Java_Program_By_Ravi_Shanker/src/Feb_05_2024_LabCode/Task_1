Program: 1
----------
Write a Program to find the following entities
1. Area of Geometric shape
2. Area of rectangle
3. Volume for cube
We have four classes named as GeometricShape, Rectangle, Cuboid and Test

For GeometricShape class
Instance Variables:
shapeType : String default 
area : double default

No Argument constructor with initialize shapeType and area with default values.  

Methods: 
public double computeArea(double value1, double value2)  : Return default area .
public void show() : print all the details of GeometricShape


For Rectangle class is a sub class of GeometricShape
Instance Variables:
width : double private 
length : double private

No Argument constructor with initialize width and length as 10.

Methods : set and get methods for width and length

@Override
computeArea(double width, double length): It initialize the instance variable height,
width, area and also return the area. 

@Override
show() : print length, width and area of Rectangle

For Cuboid class is a sub class of Rectangle
Instance Variables:
height : double private
Methods: set and get method for height and computeArea(double ,double ,double)

No Argument constructor with initialize height as 15

public double computeArea(double width, double length, double height) : Invoke the computeArea() 
method of the parent class using super to calculate the base area and Set the height and compute
 the total area by multiplying the base area with the height and return the area.

@Override
show() : print width, length, height and area of cuboid.

Create a Test class ans create  instances of Rectangle and Cuboid, computes their areas, 
and displays the details using the show() method. 


Program 2
---------
Create a BLC class Named as Shape and it have three sub classes named as Circle, 
Triangle and Square for each class have two methods called as draw() and erase()

Main class named as ShapeDemo

For Shape class
Methods: 
public static Shape randshape()
No Argument constructor

randshape() : Using switch ((int)Math.randome()*3) 
case 0: create an object for Circle Object using return
case 1: create an object for Square Object using return
case 2: create an object for Triangle Object using return
default: Print as default message
finally return an object for Shape class

Use this class to test your solution's class and methods in main method
For Shape class

Methods: In draw():void and erase():void and No argument constructor
draw(): print "shape draw" 
erase(): print "Shape erase"

//Sub Classes

For Circle class sub class of Shape class
Methods: In draw():void and erase():void and No argument constructor
Override:
draw() method print "Circle draw" and erase() method print "Circle erase"

For Triangle class sub class of Shape class
Methods: In draw():void and erase():void and No argument constructor
Override:
draw() method print "Triangle draw" and erase() method print "Triangle erase"

For Square class sub class of Shape class
Methods: In draw():void and erase():void and No argument constructor
Override:
draw() method print "Square draw" and erase() method print "Square erase"
