Program: 1
----------
Create two BLC classes Person and PanCard, both must be declared with public access modifier. 
Create one ELC class Test which contains main method to test the application 
Designing of Person class : 
Instance Variable : 
private PanCard obj; 
create a parameterized constructor which accept PanCard class as a parameter, In this constructor 
initialize the instance variable and call the non static display method of PanCard class. 
Designing of PanCard class : 
Instance Variable : private String panId; 
create one no argument constructor where initialize the 
panId and create the object of Person class 
Define display method to print panId; Define main method in ELC class Test to test the application.

Program 02 :
------------
Create a BLC class called A
 Instance variable
 private int data = 15;

 Create a no-argument constructor, where create the object for class B (Another BLC class) and call the non-static display method available in class B.

 Create an instance method show() in class A, which will print instance variable data.

 Create an another BLC class B
 Instance variable
 private A obj;
 
 Create a parameterized constructor which takes class A as a parameter to initialize the instance variable

 Create a display method inside class B which internally calling the show() method of class A

 Create an ELC class Test which contains main method to test the application.

 Note :- BLC and ELC all the classes must be declared as public.

 Expected Output:

instance variable data in A = 15













Program 03 :
------------
Create a class Employee (Business Logic Class)

 Instance Variables:
 employeeNumber : private-int
 employeeName : private-String
 employeeSalary:private -double 

 Create a parameterized constructor to initialilize all the fields.
 Create getters method for all the instance variables.

 Create another class Main which contains main method (ELC class) which will receive all the instance variable value from BLC class.

 In this ELC class print the following details

 a) If salary is >=60000, Print Employee is a Developer

 b) If salary is >=40000 and <60000 , Print Employee is a Designer

 c) If Salary is <40000 , Print Employee is a Tester

Input:

232, "Naresh", 43000



Output:
Employee is a Designer
