Que-1)
Write a java which program the sum of digits of the given two digit number.
program determined by the following rules:

if the given value is in between 10 and 99, return sum of it's digits. Example: if x = 34, print 7
if the given value is negative, print -3
if the given value is greater than 99, print -2
if the given value is in between 0 and 9, print -1

Que-2)
Write a java program which print the next multiple of 100 for the given number.
Program is determined by the following rules:

if the given value is negative or zero, return -1
if the given value is positive, return the next multiple of the given number. Example: if x = 123, return 200.

Que-3)
Write a java program which print the given three digit number is palindrome or not 

Program is determined by the following rules:

if the given number is an three digit number, Example: if x = 232, print 1. if x = 345, print 0
if 1 then print a message that the number is pallindrome
if 0 then print a message that the number is not a pallindrome
if the given number is negative or zero, print -1
if -1 then print a message that the given number is -ve kindly provide the +ve number only
if the given number is not an three digit number, print -2
if -2 then print the message that this program can check the operation for the 3 number only.
