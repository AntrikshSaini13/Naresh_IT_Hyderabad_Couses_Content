Abstract class and abstract methods :
-------------------------------------------
A class that does not provide complete implementation (partial implementation) is defined 
as an abstract class.

An abstract method is a common method which is used to provide easiness to the programmer 
because the programmer faces complexcity to remember the method name.

An abstract method observation is very simple because every abstract method contains abstract 
keyword, abstract method does not contain any method body and at the end there must be a terminator 
i.e ; (semicolon)

In java whenever action is common but implementations are different then we should use abstract 
method, Generally we declare abstract method in the super class and its implementation must be 
provided in the sub classes.

if a class contains at least one method as an abstract method then we should compulsory declare 
that class as an abstract class.

Once a class is declared as an abstract class we can't create an object for that class.

*All the abstract methods declared in the super class must be overridden in the sub classes otherwise 
the sub class will become as an abstract class hence object can't be created for the sub class as well.

In an abstract class we can write all abstract method or all concrete method or combination of both 
the method. 

It is used to acheive partial abstraction that means by using abstract classes we can acheive partial 
abstraction(0-100%).

*An abstract class may or may not have abstract method but an abstract method must have abstract class.

Note :- We can't declare an abstract method as final, private and static (illegal combination of modifiers)

BirdDemo.java
--------------
abstract class Bird
{
	public abstract void fly();	
}
class Parrot extends Bird
{
	@Override
	public void fly()
	{
		System.out.println("Parrot can fly");
	}
}
class Sparrow extends Bird
{
	@Override
	public void fly()
	{
		System.out.println("Sparrow can fly");
	}
}

public class BirdDemo 
{
	public static void main(String[] args) 
	{
		Bird b;

		b = new Parrot(); 
		b.fly();

		b = new Sparrow(); 
		b.fly();
	}
}
---------------------------------------------------------------
abstract class Car
{
	protected int speed = 80;

	public Car()
	{
		System.out.println("Car class Constructor!!");
	}

	public void getDetails()
	{
		System.out.println("It has 4 wheels and one Engine");
	}

	public abstract void run();
}

class Honda extends Car
{
	@Override
	public void run()
	{
		System.out.println("Honda Car is Running");
	}
}

public class InterviewQuestion 
{
	public static void main(String[] args) 
	{
		Car c = new Honda();
		System.out.println("Speed is :"+c.speed);
		c.getDetails();
		c.run();
	}
}

****Note :- In an abstract class if we have any constructor then it will be executed by sub 
class object using super keyword.

What is the advantage of writing constructor in abstract class?
