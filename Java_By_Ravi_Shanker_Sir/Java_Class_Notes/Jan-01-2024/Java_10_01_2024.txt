What is Garbage Collector in Java ?
------------------------------------
In Java the programmer is only responsible to allocate the memory by using constructor, memory de-allocation is not 
the responsibility of the programmer. 
It is automatically done by garbage collector.

As we know all the objects are created inside the HEAP Memory where as all our methods are executed inside stack memory.

The main purpose of GC(Garbage Collector) to scan the heap memory, identify which objects are eligible for GC and which 
objects are not eligible. (An object is eligible for GC if that object does not contain any references)


How many ways we can make an object eligible for GC :
-----------------------------------------------------
There are 3 ways we can make an object eligible for GC.

1) Assigning null literal to reference variable :
   Employee e1 = new Employee(111,"Ravi");
            e1 = null;

2) Creating an Object inside a method :

   public void createObject()
   {
      Employee e2 = new Employee();
   }
Here we are creating Employee object inside the method so, once the method execution is over then e2 will be deleted 
from the Stack Frame and the employee object will become eligible for GC.

3) Assigning new Object to the old existing reference variable:
   
   Employee e3 = new Employee();
   e3 = new Employee();

Earlier e3 variable was poting to Employee object after that a new Employee Object is created which is pointing to 
another memory location so the first object is eligible for GC.
