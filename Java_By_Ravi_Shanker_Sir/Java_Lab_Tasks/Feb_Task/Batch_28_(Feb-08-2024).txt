Program 01 :
------------
Create an application to compare two objects based on the content by overriding the equals(Object obj) 
method of Object class.

Create a BLC class called Product

Instance variables :
private int productId
private String productName

Create a parameterized constructor to initialize all properties.

Override equals(Object obj) method from Object class to compare the content of Product object, 
Make sure that if end user try to compare the content of two different objects (Product and Employee) 
then program should provide proper message.

Create an ELC class ProductEquality to test your application by creating two objects of Product class to 
compare the content by calling Product class overridden equals(Object obj) method.

Program 02 :
------------

Methods: 
getName(String): String, 
getNumberOfTeamMembers() :String
getName method returns a String value as "Sports".
